# Reinforcement-Learning-2024
## What this is
This project contains algorithms one writes for the [Hugging FaceDeep RL Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction), specifically, its hands-on assignments, only that they are written from scratch following the style of [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) and with Jupyter for better clarity. 
## Remarks
Unfortunately the codes, wirtten by Sep 2024, do not run properly when I checked in Jan 2026. Some of the dependencies, for example, seem to have been removed (e.g. Jaxlib 0.4.7) and no longer solvable by Poetry. 
I keep this repo for my own record and for anyone who might be interested.
